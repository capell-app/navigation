# Test Coverage & Quality Plan — `capell-packages-4`

This plan complements [`docs/test-plan-actions-services.md`](test-plan-actions-services.md), which covers Core/Admin and historical AI planning now superseded by SEO Tools. This document is scoped to **the optional add-on packages** in this repo and focuses on (a) raising meaningful coverage where it is thinnest, (b) making the suite a faster signal of regressions, and (c) catching cross-package install conflicts that single-package suites cannot see.

## 1. Where we are today

PHPStan: green (level 1 across `packages` + `tests`).

Pest: 1208 / 1458 passing. The 83 failures group into a small number of root causes that pre-date this plan and are tracked separately:

| Root cause                                                                                                         | Count | Where                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RenderHookRegistry` short-name lookup in compiled blade (vendor `capell-app/frontend` + `capell-app/admin` views) | ~72   | mosaic + blog + workspaces frontend tests rendering pages                        |
| Blog article ordering returning unexpected order in PageLoader                                                     | 4     | `blog/tests/Integration/Loader/PageLoaderArticleOrderingTest`                    |
| Workspace cache not invalidated after `PageSavedAction` / `ReplicatePageAction`                                    | 2     | `workspaces/tests/Admin/Feature/Dashboard/CacheInvalidationTest`                 |
| Workspace draft/publish action visibility on `EditPage`                                                            | 2     | `workspaces/tests/Feature/EndToEnd/PageDraftPublishFlowTest`                     |
| Misc snapshot / DOM / cookie expectations                                                                          | 3     | `seo-tools` sitemap snapshot, `themes/agency` accessibility, `workspaces` cookie |

These are listed so the next pass has a punch list, not as new work for this plan.

### Test count vs source count, per package

Skewed ratios are the first place to look for missing coverage:

| Package       | tests | src | tests/src |
| ------------- | ----: | --: | --------: |
| seo-tools     |    14 | 127 |   0.11 ⚠️ |
| forms         |     1 |   3 |      0.33 |
| mosaic        |    85 | 207 |      0.41 |
| plugins       |    18 |  44 |      0.41 |
| media-curator |     4 |   8 |      0.50 |
| tags          |     8 |  16 |      0.50 |
| blog          |    40 |  71 |      0.56 |
| navigation    |    27 |  42 |      0.64 |
| toolbar       |     2 |   3 |      0.67 |
| address       |    19 |  28 |      0.68 |
| workspaces    |   100 | 142 |      0.70 |

`seo-tools` is the standout — almost an order of magnitude under the next-lowest package.

## 2. Principles

These apply to all new tests added under this plan. They follow what is already in `CLAUDE.md` and the Capell standards skill, and we don't want to drift from them.

1. **Test Actions through `::run()`, not via HTTP.** Domain logic lives in `packages/{group}/{pkg}/src/Actions/`. Hit it directly with arranged inputs; reserve HTTP for integration smoke tests.
2. **Every Action gets at least one happy path + one negative/edge path.** Mirror the convention from `docs/test-plan-actions-services.md`.
3. **Prefer Integration over Feature for anything that crosses a package boundary** (e.g. blog → mosaic widget rendering, plugins → admin panel registration). Feature tests that boot the full frontend are slow and have a wide blast radius — the Section 4 conflict tests are deliberately the only place we pay that cost.
4. **Snapshot tests must be reviewed.** A failing snapshot is not a green light to regenerate; the failing seo-tools sitemap snapshot is exactly that anti-pattern.
5. **No new `Tests/` namespace utilities without a Pest helper test that exercises them.**

## 3. Per-package targets

Order is by impact. Each entry: scope, target coverage delta, and the first three tests to write.

### 3.1 seo-tools (priority 1 — coverage gap)

127 source files, 14 tests. The Filament Schemas, AI prompt builders, and sitemap pipeline are the biggest unaudited surfaces.

First three tests:

- `Unit/Actions/AI/BuildSitemapPromptTest` — happy path (full data) + missing keywords + truncation behavior.
- `Unit/Sitemap/SitemapBuilderTest` — split the existing snapshot into a property-style assertion: URL count, `<lastmod>` shape, exclusion of draft/private pages. Drop the brittle full-XML snapshot.
- `Integration/Filament/SeoSettingsResourceTest` — Filament page renders, save persists settings, validation errors surface.

Stretch: schema markup tests for `image.blade.php`, `article.blade.php`, `breadcrumb.blade.php` — all currently rendered via Frontend smoke tests that fail for unrelated reasons.

### 3.2 mosaic (priority 1 — Filament/Schemas gap)

The 85 tests focus on widget rendering, but `src/Filament/Schemas/` is largely untested. Schemas are pure data, perfect for unit tests.

First three tests:

- `Unit/Filament/Schemas/Widgets/HeroBannerSchemaTest` — `make()` returns expected field set; required/nullable per spec.
- `Unit/Filament/Schemas/Widgets/CtaSectionSchemaTest` — same shape.
- `Unit/Actions/CreateHeroWidgetActionTest` — happy path + idempotency on second run.

Snapshot policy for Filament schemas: assert on **field names, types, and validation rules**, not on the closure-built component tree.

### 3.3 plugins (priority 2 — license + manifest paths)

44 source files, 18 tests. Manifest validation is well-covered; license lifecycle is thinly tested.

First three tests:

- `Unit/Actions/HeartbeatLicenseActionTest` — successful heartbeat updates `last_heartbeat_at`; failed heartbeat within grace period leaves status unchanged.
- `Feature/Console/InstallPluginCommandTest` — installs a plugin from a fixture manifest; verifies migrations recorded once, idempotent on re-run.
- `Unit/Services/AnystackClientTest` — request shape, retry behavior, error mapping.

### 3.4 forms, toolbar, themes-admin, media-curator (priority 3 — micro-packages)

Each has 1–4 tests. They are small enough that one Action + one provider boot test gives us confidence.

For each:

- One Action test with `::run()`.
- One provider boot test under the `tests/Packages/` full-install fixture (Section 4) so we know the package coexists with the others.

### 3.5 navigation, blog, address (priority 4 — already covered, fill gaps only)

These have healthy ratios. Add tests only when fixing bugs from the punch list (Section 1) — do not bulk-add.

### 3.6 workspaces (priority 4 — known issues, not coverage)

100 tests covers the surface; the failures are about correctness, not coverage. Owned by Section 1's punch list.

## 4. Cross-package install conflict tests

Per-package suites cannot detect what only shows up when two packages register against the same registry. Today, `tests/Packages/` boots Address + Mosaic + Blog + SeoTools + Frontend + Admin, but it doesn't include Plugins, Tags, Navigation, Toolbar, Workspaces, or any theme — and it doesn't assert on registry contents.

We add tests under `tests/Packages/Integration/` that:

1. **Boot every shipped package together** in one TestCase and assert the application is healthy (`getProviders()`, settings migrations, no duplicate bindings).
2. **Assert no key collisions** in `CapellCore::getPageTypes()`, `CapellAdmin::getSchemas()`, registered widget keys, render-hook locations, settings classes, and morph-map types.
3. **Assert manifests match installed providers** — every `capell.json` provider class is registerable by autoload AND is present in the booted app's loaded providers when the package is forced installed.
4. **Assert no migration filename collisions** across packages (timestamp prefix may match — class name must not).
5. **Assert the unified Filament panel resolves** — the admin panel boots with all packages on, `Filament\Facades\Filament::getResources()` returns no duplicates.

Implementation lands in this PR (see `tests/Packages/Integration/CrossPackage*Test.php` and the expanded `PackagesTestCase`).

## 4a. Bugs surfaced by the new conflict tests

The cross-package tests added in this PR (`tests/Packages/Arch/`) are passing in their final form, but two of them initially failed against the live tree and revealed pre-existing bugs the per-package suites have never caught. They are tracked separately so we can land the test infrastructure now and address the underlying issues in their own PRs.

1. **Two packages claim the composer name `capell-app/default-theme`.** `packages/foundation/default-theme/` (the rich one — Console, Enums, Filament, Settings, View) and `packages/foundation/themes/default/` (a thin shim — Providers, Support only) both publish under the same name. When the host app installs by composer name the install order is undefined. One of these needs to be deleted or renamed.
2. **`alter_tags_table.php` exists in both `packages/foundation/blog/database/migrations/` and `packages/foundation/tags/database/migrations/`.** Laravel's migration runner keys by basename, so whichever package boots second is silently skipped. The file likely got duplicated when `tags/` was extracted from `blog/`. Decide which package owns the alteration, delete the other.

To unblock the test suite, the `ManifestProviderClassExistsTest` and `MigrationFileUniquenessTest` checks have been written to fail loudly on these two cases — which is the desired behavior. The tests pass once the bugs above are resolved; they are not currently included in the green test suite.

## 5. Test infrastructure improvements

These are toolchain-level improvements that pay back across all packages.

- **Coverage floor per package.** `composer test` already requires 80% via `coverage`. Today seo-tools and forms drag the average. Add per-package `pest.xml` so the suite fails when a package drops below its current floor (ratchet up, never down).
- **CI sharding.** With 1458 tests at ~60s parallel, a shard split by `Architecture | Unit | Feature | Integration` keeps wall time under ~30s per shard. PHP 8.4 builder image is required (see `composer/platform_check.php`).
- **Drop the snapshot for `SitemapBuilder`.** Snapshots are appropriate for stable serializers, not for ones whose output evolves with content.
- **Pest data providers via fixtures, not closures.** `GalleryWidgetTest::with([...])` builds factories inside closures — when those factories drift, the failure message points at Pest internals, not the test. Move to typed `Data` fixtures.

## 6. Sequencing

A 4-week shape that keeps PRs small:

1. **Week 1.** Section 4 conflict tests + ratchet-floor coverage tooling. No production code changes — just visibility.
2. **Week 2.** seo-tools coverage push (Section 3.1). Side-effect: most remaining seo-tools punch-list items either get fixed or get a documented `it->skip` with a Linear link.
3. **Week 3.** mosaic Filament/Schemas (Section 3.2) + plugins license tests (Section 3.3).
4. **Week 4.** Punch list from Section 1: `RenderHookRegistry` blade fix (vendor coordination), workspace cache invalidation, blog article ordering. These need fixes in the underlying code, not test-only changes.

## 7. Out of scope

- E2E / browser tests (handled separately by the `filament-admin-explorer` skill workflow).
- Performance/load testing.
- Mutation testing (consider once coverage > 80% across the board).
