Capell Address adds country and address management to Capell. It is useful for branch pages, local business schema, contact pages, offices, venues, and any package that needs reusable address fields.

## When to install it

Install Address when sites or content records need structured location data instead of plain text address fields.

## Quick install

```bash
composer require capell-app/address
php artisan capell:address-install
php artisan capell:address-demo
```

## What appears in the admin

| Area          | What editors can do                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Countries     | Manage country records                                           |
| Addresses     | Manage reusable address records                                  |
| Site settings | Attach address and country data through the Site schema extender |

## What developers get

- `CountrySelect` and `AddressSelect` Filament form components.
- Runtime relationships such as `Site::address()` and `Site::country()`.
- Address data stored in the site's `meta` JSON so the core `sites` table stays untouched.
- Factories for demo content and package tests.

## Example usage

```php
$site = Site::find(1);

echo $site->address?->full_address;
echo $site->country?->iso2;
```
