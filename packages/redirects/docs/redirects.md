# Redirect Manager

The redirects package manages 301 and 302 redirects, import/export, and automatic redirects when page slugs change. It keeps using Capell's existing `page_urls` table for redirect storage.

---

## Data model

The `page_urls` table stores redirects with:

| Column        | Purpose                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `target_url`  | Destination URL for manual redirects (null for auto-generated slug history rows) |
| `status_code` | 301 or 302, backed by `RedirectStatusCodeEnum`                                   |
| `is_manual`   | Distinguishes user-created redirects from auto-generated ones                    |
| `hit_count`   | Number of times this redirect has fired                                          |
| `last_hit_at` | Last time the redirect fired                                                     |
| `notes`       | Optional admin notes                                                             |

Auto-generated redirects resolve through `pageable_id` and slug history. Manual redirects resolve through `target_url`.

## Admin resource

`RedirectResource` is a Filament single-page resource (`ManageRedirects`) scoped to `type = redirect`:

- Full CRUD with `RedirectForm` / `RedirectsTable` configurators.
- Table filters by site, language, status code, hit-count buckets.
- Site and language selectors on the form, defaulting to the current admin context.
- Import (CSV via Filament Importer) and Export (CSV via Filament Exporter).
- Permission-gated via `RedirectPolicy`, including dedicated `import` / `export` gates.

The redirects package registers this resource with Capell Admin from `RedirectsServiceProvider`.

## Validation

`ValidateRedirectAction` runs on every save and import row:

- **Duplicate detection** - source URL already has a redirect on the same site / language.
- **Self-redirect prevention** - `source_url === target_url`.
- **Loop detection** - follows the redirect chain up to 10 hops, aborting if it finds a cycle.
- **Chain warnings** - a redirect whose target is itself a redirect is allowed but surfaces a warning in the admin.

## CSV import / export

- **`RedirectImporter`** uses Filament's `Importer` base class with per-column mapping and automatic header detection. Site and language are picked once on the import screen and applied to every row. Failed rows are reported per-row without aborting the import.
- **`RedirectExporter`** outputs all manual-redirect columns, filterable by the same table filters.

## Frontend resolution

Frontend page resolution delegates redirect decisions to `RedirectResolver`. The default `PageUrlRedirectResolver` resolves active `page_urls` rows of `type = redirect` and issues a `301` or `302` according to the row's `status_code`. Hit count and `last_hit_at` are updated on every match.

## Configuration

```php
'auto_redirects' => [
    'enabled' => env('CAPELL_REDIRECTS_AUTO_ENABLED', true),
    'status_code' => 301,
],
```
