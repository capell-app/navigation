## Regenerating

**Prerequisites:**

- A Capell admin panel running locally (e.g. `http://capell-ruby.local/admin/`)
- Admin user credentials
- The host app's `AdminPanelProvider` registering `WorkspaceResource` (otherwise workspace screenshots 05–07 aren't reachable — add `->resources([WorkspaceResource::class])` to the panel)

**Simple manual capture (recommended):**

1. Log into the admin panel in Chrome.
2. Use macOS `Cmd+Shift+4` / `Cmd+Shift+5` (or your OS equivalent) to capture each view listed above.
3. Save each PNG into this directory using the filenames above.

**Scripted capture with Playwright:**

A ready-to-run script lives in the `capell` host repo at `scripts/capture-admin-screenshots.mjs`.

```bash
npm install --save-dev playwright
npx playwright install chromium

ADMIN_URL=http://capell-ruby.local/admin \
ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com \
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret \
node scripts/capture-admin-screenshots.mjs
```

The script logs in, captures each of the 7 views, and writes them into this directory. Workspace-specific screens (05–07) are skipped with a warning if the host panel doesn't register `WorkspaceResource`.
